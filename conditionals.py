#Indentation
"""
==> Increase indent indent after an if statement or for statement (after : )
==> Maintain indent to indicate the scope of the block (which lines are affected by the if/or)
==> Reduce indent back to the level of the if statement or for statement to indicate the end of the block
==> Blank lines are ignored - they do not affect indentation
==> Comments on a line by themselves are ignored with regard to indentation
